# WebScraper
This web scraper can grab public data from static HTML pages. I used an HTTP Client to request data from a website. This was made in C#.

# Message Chat App
This application has a server and can handle multiple clients with the use of Tasks/multithreading in C#. This application was also made in XAML for the front end.

# Encryptor/Decryptor App
This application is made to read text files and the user has the option to encrypt and decrypt those files. The algorithms used are Caeser Cipher and ROT13. This application was also made in XAML for the front end.
