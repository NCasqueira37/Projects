Personal Projects made by me

## WebScraper
This web scraper can grab public data from static HTML pages. I used an HTTP Client to request data from a website. This was made in C#.

## Message Chat App
This application has a server and can handle multiple clients with the use of Tasks/multithreading in C#. I constructed the Front and Back end of this application.

## Encryptor/Decryptor App
This application is made to read text files and the user has the option to encrypt and decrypt those files while also the choice of changing the algorithms used. The algorithms used are Caeser Cipher and ROT13. This application was also made in XAML for the front end. This was made in C#.
